\begin{abstract}
This document is a midterm progress report that covers a brief introduction of our senior project, our current progress, problems that have impeded our progress, and any preliminary results that have been gathered. It also describes what is left to do before all of the requirements are met for the project along with the potential for some stretch goals if time allows. This report includes a few interesting pieces of code and a description of what this code does. It is constructed using the IEEEtran style guidelines.
